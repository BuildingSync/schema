    "# Energy Auditing with BuildingSync\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "So you've been tasked with performing an energy audit that requires submission of a BuildingSync document? What does that even mean? This notebook is intended to provide an interactive and informational introduction to what BuildingSync is and how it relates to buildings, building systems, and energy audit reporting. This will be done by performing an example energy audit on the DOE Small Office Prototype building.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Who This is For\n",
    "While this notebook is setup in Python, this introduction is not reserved only for software developers. The code is more of a supplement, but doesn't need to be run. Energy auditors, mechanical engineers, AHJ's procuring audits, and software developers all have something to gain from walking through this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you should:\n",
    "- Have a practical understanding of some XML features, namely: elements, attributes, and xpaths\n",
    "- Know the main elements of the BuildingSync schema: Buildings, Systems, Reports, Scenarios, TimeSeriesData\n",
    "- Be able to relate these concepts back to an ASHRAE Standard 211 energy audit\n",
    "- Create a minimum viable Level 1 BuildingSync document and verify it validates using the [BuildingSync Use Case Validator](https://buildingsync.net/validator)\n",
    "\n",
    "## For Reference: Core Concepts and Notation Used\n",
    "- We will be using BuildingSync version 2.3.0. [Documentation](https://buildingsync.net/documentation/2.3.0). [Github release](https://github.com/BuildingSync/schema/releases/tag/v2.3.0).\n",
    "- BuildingSync is an XML Schema Document (XSD). It defines intended structure. Referring to something as a BuildingSync document typically means the document is intended to conform to the BuildingSync schema.\n",
    "- An XSD defines a hierarchical or tree-based schema, where elements are 'nested' within other elements. An XML document then looks like nested elements within one another. Similar to HTML, it uses angle brackets `<` and `>` to open and close an element tag. The example below provides a very simple example of an XML document:\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<a-root-node>\n",
    "    <first-child>This child element captures information in a string (text), whereas the second-child captures a numeric datatype.</first-child>\n",
    "    <second-child>2</second-child>\n",
    "</a-root-node>\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `auc:` is often used as the namespace prefix for elements in a BuildingSync document. If a document declares the BuildingSync namespace prefix to be `auc:`, an element would look like `auc:Facility`. The same element in a BuildingSync document without a namespace prefix would look like `Facility`. Going forward, we will not prefix elements with `auc` - the remaining XML content should only refer to things defined by the BuildingSync schema.\n",
    "- XPath: xpath is basically a syntax for 'walking' an xml tree, mainly used for 'querying' information out of an XML document. In the simple example xml document above, to get the `<first-child>` element, we would notate this in XPath as `/a-root-node/first-child`. XPath will be used throughout this document to concisely convey where elements can be found in a BuildingSync document.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Caveats\n",
    "- These cells are meant to be run 1x through sequentially. Running a single cell multiple times may give you bad results"

    "Let's start by defining a building. In this exercise, we will learn about some BuildingSync design patterns that will continue to propagate. In xpath terms, buildings live here: `/BuildingSync/Facilities/Facility/Sites/Site/Buildings/Building`. A few things to notice:\n",
    "- The root node of a BuildingSync document is the `BuildingSync` element\n",
    "- Plurals (Facilities, Sites, Buildings) are often used to indicate parents that can contain 1 <= n < infinite child elements having a non-pluralized name (Facility, Site, Building). For example:\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<BuildingSync>\n",
    "    <Facilities>\n",
    "        <Facility ID=\"F-1\">\n",
    "            ...children stuff here...\n",
    "        </Facility>\n",
    "        <Facility ID=\"F-2\">\n",
    "            ...children stuff here...\n",
    "        </Facility>\n",
    "    </Facilities>\n",
    "</BuildingSync>\n",
    "```\n",
    "- While the above can be done, it is __most common__ to find a single Facility, Site, and Building in a BuildingSync document. In general:\n",
    "    - Facility refers to a grouping of Sites, but a Facility is still geographically proximate. Its boundary might include not building specific things (streets, sidewalks, etc.)\n",
    "    - A Site is everything in and around a group of Buildings. This might be two Buildings that are connected via a tunnel, etc.\n",
    "    - ** Most common is just to have a single Building\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary BuildingSync Structural Elements\n",
    "We start by creating the primary structure of a BuildingSync document. We introduced `Facilities`, `Sites`, and `Buildings`, but there are a few additional:\n",
    "- `Sections` are subportions of a `Building`. Think of a mixed-use commercial building with retail and office space, each of these would become a section. For those familiar with the ASHRAE 211 Normative Spreadsheet, a `Section` is analagous to a column in the `All - Space Functions` sheet.\n",
    "- `Systems` are defined under a `Facility` and capture the energy consuming / producing assets. Each can be linked back to an individual `Facility`, `Site`, `Building`, or `Section`.\n",
    "- `Reports` are defined under a `Facility` and each `Report` would contain information about reporting type requirements. Most importantly, a `Report` contains a set of `Scenario` elements, where each `Scenario` would convey building performance for one of: current / historical data, target performance, benchmark performance, baseline modeled performance, or expected performance with measure(s) implemented."
