Here you can find Jupyter Notebooks which serve as guides for using BuildingSync. Currently there is only one notebook for a small office building with a Level 1 energy audit.

# Setup

- `pip install poetry`
- `poetry install`
- `poetry run jupyter lab`

Navigate to the `bsync_examples/Small-Office-Level-1.md`, right click on the file and select `Open With -> Jupytext Notebook`, then walk through the example.
