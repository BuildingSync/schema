Here you can find Jupyter Notebooks which serve as guides for using BuildingSync. Currently there are several notebooks for prototype small office and primary school buildings with ASHRAE Level 1 and 2 energy audit.

# Setup

From the root directory of the repo, run the following commands to set up the environment. 

- `pip install poetry`
- `poetry install`

Then navigate to the docs/notebooks directory and launch Jupyter Lab:

- `poetry run jupyter lab`

Navigate to the notebook examples (e.g., `bsync_examples/Small-Office-Level-1.md`), right click on the file and select `Open With -> Jupytext Notebook`, then walk through the example.
