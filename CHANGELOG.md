* Pluralize TechnologyCategory to TechnologyCategories

## Version 0.2

Version 0.2 changes are listed below. The big change for 0.2 was the resetting of the version number from 2.0 to 0.2.

#### 3/22/2016 
* Hendron changed Space element to unconstrained.

#### 2/24/2016-3/2/2016 Hendron - BEDES V1.2 updates

* Updated enumeration for RoofSlope
* Updated punctuation in enumeration for GlassType, FenestrationGlassLayers, FenestrationFrameMaterial
* Updated enumeration for ExteriorShadingType to include trees and buildings
* Updated enumeration for SkylightWindowTreatments to match BEDES Shading System options
* Renamed CrawlspaceVenting options to match BEDES terminology (ventilated vs vented)
* Updated BasementConditioning options
* Added Linoleum to FloorCovering enumeration
* Moved FloorConstructionType to the main FoundationType level from the vented crawlspace
* Removed Combination from enumeration for FoundationWallInsulationCondition
* Added FoundationWallUFactor element for basements and unvented crawlspaces
* Renamed Set Top Box under PlugLoadType to match BEDES
* Deleted Motor from ProcessLoadType enumeration because there is a separate category for motor data
* Replaced stand-alone DutyCycle element with the global element DutyCycle under ProcessLoadType
* Updated enumeration for PhotovoltaicSystemLocation, changing Ground to On Grade and deleting hyphen
* Updated punctuation for ExternalPowerSupply
* Deleted acronyms and updated punctuation in enumeration for EnergyStorageTechnology
* Deleted fountains, etc., from PoolType because there is a separate category for water used in landscaping features
* Changed Indoors and Outdoors to Interior and Exterior in enumeration for Location to match BEDES
* Updated punctuation in enumeration for FuelTypes and deleted Combination
* Updated enumeration for CapacityUnits
* Added values to enumeration for Source
* Renamed ModificationRetrocommissioning to Modification to allow clean mapping to BEDES
* Deleted hyphens in enumeration for WeatherDataSource
* Changed name of Simulated element to Modeled to match BEDES terminology.
* Added enumeration to CodeName matching BEDES, except 189.1 because ASHRAE was already in the list. Previously it was free text. A new element CodeVersion was added as free text to allow more specific definition of the relevant code or standard.
* Removed hyphens from EndUse enumeration and aligned several options with BEDES. The "Whole building" option in BuildingSync was changed to "All end uses", because the associated premises are defined in a separate element, and it may be less than the whole building.
* Changed EnergyResource enumeration to global type FuelType 
* Deleted acronyms and updated punctuation in enumeration for CostEffectivenessScreeningMethod
* Corrected definition of PercentResource
* Updated enumeration for ResourceUnits

#### 2/23/2016-3/2/2016 Hendron - Minor cleanup
* Changed definition of Story element under Subsection to "The story of the given subsection." 
* Made FacilityClassification optional
* Capitalized "facility"
* Deleted SpecialCeilingClassification (other cleanup of ceiling/roof split is needed to remove redundancies)
* Deleted RoofVisibleAbsorptance, because this is only important as a ceiling property
* Deleted DeckType, CeilingSlope, RadiantBarrier, CeilingExteriorSolarAbsorptance, CeilingExteriorThermalAbsorptance from CeilingSystemType because they are more appropriate as roof attributes
* Renamed all CeilingInsulation elements to have "Ceiling" modifier instead of "Roof"
* Added references to CeilingID, CeilingArea, and CeilingInsulatedArea under Subsection, and redistributed relevant elements from under RoofID
* Split Ceiling and Roof under SystemCategoryAffected
* Dropped Not Discarded from enumeration for DiscardReason. The existence of the element implies that the measure was discarded.
* Added WeatherDataSource element under AdjustedToYear. Appears to have been an oversight.
* Copied AnnualDemandSavingsCost from MeasureType to PackageOfMeasures for consistency
* Updated definition of NetMetering because it is no longer a boolean.
* Fixed error in datatype for ApplicableStartTimeForEnergyRate, ApplicableEndTimeForEnergyRate, ApplicableStartTimeForDemandRate, and ApplicableEndTimeForDemandRate (from date to time)
* DaylitFloorArea (added recently by NREL) was deleted as a separate element. "Daylit" was already an option for FloorAreaType, so it was redundant.
* Added "Mixed use commercial" and "Other" to enumeration for FacilityClassification
* Renamed CommercialFacility global type to Facility for consistency.

##### 11/20/2015 - 12/10/2015

* Add Country to Address
* Add FloorsAboveGrade and FloorsBelowGrade to the Facility 
* Add Story to FloorArea Type
* Add AssemblyType to Windows and Skylights (double hung, curb mounted, etc)
* Add Space->Daylit Area
* Add Story to subsection
* Add WallInsulationRValue to WallInsulation
* Add another level for WallInsulations in WallSystems
* Rename CommercialFacility to Facility and add enum to specify the facility type
