# Add YearBurnerInstalled

## Overview

There is no YearBurnerInstalled field on Boiler and Furnace paths.

## Justification

There exists a need for users to add YearBurnerInstalled on the burner path, which is found under both Boiler and Furnace.

## Implementation

This proposal is to:
1. Add the following path:
BuildingSync/Facilities/Facility/Systems/HVACSystems/HVACSystem/HeatingAndCoolingSystems/HeatingSources/HeatingSource/HeatingSourceType/Furnace/YearBurnerInstalled

2. Add the following path: 
BuildingSync/Facilities/Facility/Systems/HVACSystems/HVACSystem/Plants/HeatingPlants/HeatingPlant/Boiler/YearBurnerInstalled
