# Add YearBurnerInstalled

## Overview

There is no year burner installed field on Boiler and Furnace paths.

## Justification

There exists a need for users to add year burner installed on the burner path, which is found under both Boiler and Furnace.

## Implementation

The proposed name of the element has been updated to BurnerYearInstalled to allow for grouping of the Burner elements.

This proposal is to:

1. Add the following path:
   BuildingSync/Facilities/Facility/Systems/HVACSystems/HVACSystem/HeatingAndCoolingSystems/HeatingSources/HeatingSource/HeatingSourceType/Furnace/BurnerYearInstalled

2. Add the following path:
   BuildingSync/Facilities/Facility/Systems/HVACSystems/HVACSystem/Plants/HeatingPlants/HeatingPlant/Boiler/BurnerYearInstalled
