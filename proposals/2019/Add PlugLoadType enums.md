# PlugLoadType - Add Enumerations

## Overview

PlugLoadType is missing useful enumerations.

## Justification

There exists a need for certain users to have additional PlugLoadType enumerations: Broadcast antenna, Kitchen equipment, and Signage display.

Signage display in this case is to accomodate a "Times Square Sign".

## Implementation

This proposal is to:
Add the following enumerations to path:
BuildingSync/Facilities/Facility/Systems/PlugLoads/PlugLoad/PlugLoadType

1. Broadcast antenna
2. Kitchen equipment
3. Signage display
