# ControlTechnology - Add "None" Enumeration

## Overview

The `<auc:ControlTechnology>` enumeration does not have a "None" value.

## Justification

There exists a need for certain users to assert that no `<auc:ControlTechnology>` is available.

The assertion that no `<auc:ControlTechnology>` is available is disjoint to not asserting the `<auc:ControlTechnology>` element.

## Implementation

This proposal is to:

Add the following enumerations to `<auc:ControlTechnology>`:

- None
