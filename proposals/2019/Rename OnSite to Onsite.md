# Rename OnSite to Onsite

## Overview

It was discovered that we are inconsistently using OnSite and Onsite.

## Justification

There is a general need to keep BuildingSync consistent and this needs to be addressed. These will be breaking changes.

## Implementation

Rename elements that have OnSite to Onsite. This follows the BEDES definition of Onsite.

This impacts the following paths:

* BuildingSync/Facilities/Facility/Systems/OnsiteStorageTransmissionGenerationSystems/OnsiteStorageTransmissionGenerationSystem
* BuildingSync/Facilities/Facility/Systems/OnsiteStorageTransmissionGenerationSystems/OnsiteStorageTransmissionGenerationSystem/EnergyConversionType/Generation/OnsiteGenerationType
