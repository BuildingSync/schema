# Add the Address Element to a Building

## Overview

There is no way to locally identify a Qualification or Report in BuildingSync. 

## Justification

The exists a need for certain users to have a unique ID on a Report and/or a Qualification. This will allow the user to keep external data sources linked with the Report or Qualification as needed.

## Implementation

This proposal is to:
1. Add an attribute @ID on auc:Qualification
2. Add an attribute @ID on auc:Report
