# Enable Multiple Special Roof Classifications

## Overview

This proposal is to allow multiple `<auc:SpecialRoofClassification>`.

## Justification

Special roof classifications are not mutually exclusive [1].

## Implementation

This proposal is to add the following paths with annotations from BEDES:

- `//BuildingSync/Facilities/Facility/Systems/RoofSystems/RoofSystem/BlueRoof`
- `//BuildingSync/Facilities/Facility/Systems/RoofSystems/RoofSystem/CoolRoof`
- `//BuildingSync/Facilities/Facility/Systems/RoofSystems/RoofSystem/GreenRoof`
