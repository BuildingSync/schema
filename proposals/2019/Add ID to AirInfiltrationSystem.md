# OccupancyClassification - Add Enumerations

## Overview

AirInfiltrationSystem element does not have an ID element.  Most other "system" elements do.

## Justification

There exists a need to have an ID attribute on the AirInfiltrationSystem element.

## Implementation

This proposal is to add an ID attribute to path: 
BuildingSync/Facilities/Facility/Systems/AirInfiltrationSystems/AirInfiltrationSystem
