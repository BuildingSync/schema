# BuildingEnvelopeModifications - Add MeasureName to TechnologyCategory

## Overview

This proposal is to add a new `auc:MeasureName` to the `auc:TechnologyCategory` for "BuildingEnvelopeModifications".

## Justification

Excerpt from [1]:

> New York Cityâ€™s building and fire codes now allow you to either partially or fully close elevator and stairwell shaft vents.

## Implementation

Add the following `auc:MeasureName` enumerations to the following `auc:TechnologyCategory` elements:
* BuildingEnvelopeModifications
  * Close elevator and/or stairwell shaft vents
