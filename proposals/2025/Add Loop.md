# Add Loop elements

## Overview

This proposal is to add new elements related to Loop components used in BEM tools such as EnergyPlus/OpenStudio, and to map with the standardized usage of Loop or `FluidLoop` elements in ASHRAE Standard 229P - Protocols for Evaluating Ruleset Application in Building Performance Models. In 229P, `FluidLoop` element is defined and used in [schema](https://github.com/open229/ruleset-model-description-schema/blob/6509fdcc546053e13f06eb78b3fba99328fda58d/docs229/ASHRAE229.schema.json#L3316) for elements as follow:
* `HeatingSystem/hot_water_loop`
