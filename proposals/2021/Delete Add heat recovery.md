# Delete Add heat recovery

## Overview

This proposal is to delete the `Add heat recovery` measure option from the Energy Management Control Systems (EMCS) category under `BuildingAutomationSystems`.

## Justification

`Add heat recovery` measure does not fall into Building Automation System category nor EMCS category. Similar measure is captured by `Add energy recovery` measures under `OtherHVAC`, `ChillerPlantImprovements`, `BoilerPlantImprovements` and `ChilledWaterHotWaterAndSteamDistributionSystems`. This proposal suggests that we remove `Add heat recovery` from EMCS Technology Category.
