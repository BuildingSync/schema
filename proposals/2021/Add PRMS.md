# Add PRMS in eGRIDRegionCode

## Overview

This proposal is to add the enumeration `PRMS` under `eGRIDRegionCode` element.

## Justification

In February 2021, a new eGRID subregion was added: "PRMS (Puerto Rico Miscellaneous)", which currently is not an enumeration of the `auc:eGRIDRegionCode` element.
