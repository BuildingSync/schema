# Delete Install or upgrade master venting

## Overview

This proposal is to address the issue of the redundant `Install or upgrade master venting` measure option under `ChilledWaterHotWaterAndSteamDistributionSystems` and `Install or Upgrade Master Venting` measure option under `OtherHVAC`.

## Justification

`Install or upgrade master venting` measure repeats in `ChilledWaterHotWaterAndSteamDistributionSystems` and `OtherHVAC`, and we should keep only one of them. This proposal suggests that we remove it under `ChilledWaterHotWaterAndSteamDistributionSystems` and keep it under `OtherHVAC`, as master venting approach could be implemented not only in chilled or hot water system.
If we keep it under `OtherHVAC`, we need to correct the capitalization to `Install or upgrade master venting` (now it's `Install or Upgrade Master Venting`).
