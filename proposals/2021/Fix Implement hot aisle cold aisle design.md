# Fix Implement hot aisle cold aisle design

## Overview

This proposal is to fix the typo in enumeration `Implement hot aisle cold aisle design` under element `auc:DataCenterImprovements`.

## Justification

Currently in version 2.4, the enumeration is mistakenly written as `Implement hot aisle hold aisle design`. To avoid breaking change, we will add the correct enumeration in version 2.5 and delete the wrong one in version 3.0.

## Implementation
Add enumeration `Implement hot aisle cold aisle design` under element `auc:DataCenterImprovements`.
