# Delete Add or replace cooling tower

## Overview

This proposal is to address the issue of the redundant `Add or replace cooling tower` measure option under `ChillerPlantImprovements` and `OtherHVAC` categories.

## Justification

`Add or replace cooling tower` measure repeats in `ChillerPlantImprovements` and `OtherHVAC`, and we should keep only one of them. This proposal suggests that we remove it under `OtherHVAC` and keep it under `ChillerPlantImprovements`.
