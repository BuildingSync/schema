# Delete Separate SHW from heating

## Overview

This proposal is to address the issue of the redundant `Separate SHW from heating` measure option under `ChilledWaterHotWaterAndSteamDistributionSystems` and `ServiceHotWaterSystems`.

## Justification

`Separate SHW from heating` measure repeats in `ChilledWaterHotWaterAndSteamDistributionSystems` and `ServiceHotWaterSystems`, and we should keep only one of them. This proposal suggests that we remove it under `ChilledWaterHotWaterAndSteamDistributionSystems` and keep it under `ServiceHotWaterSystems`.
